# History

The **Scientific Grid Computing and Cloud Computing Resources for Community (SGCCRfC)** initiative began in **2013**, during a period of rapid transformation in scientific computing.

---

## Origins (2013)

The project was founded to commemorate and advance breakthroughs in:

- Cloud computing  
- Grid computing  
- Distributed scientific workflows  
- HPC infrastructure evolution  

Researchers at the time struggled to access unified, well-organized resources. SGCCRfC was created to **bridge that gap**.

---

## Growth (2014–2020)

Over the years, SGCCRfC expanded across scientific domains:

- 🌍 Earth & environmental sciences  
- 🔬 Physics & chemistry  
- 🧮 Mathematics & numerical methods  
- 🌋 Geophysics & geodynamics  
- 💻 Scientific computing & modeling  

Community contributions fueled content across cloud, grid, and data-intensive applications.

---

## Modern Era (2020–Present)

The platform evolved into a global, multi-domain wiki integrating:

- GitHub repositories  
- Open-source research tools  
- YouTube lectures and MOOCs  
- Scientific datasets  
- Computational frameworks  

Today, SGCCRfC is a **non-profit**, open-access knowledge base serving scientists, students, and research communities worldwide.

## Continuing Journey

The project continues to grow with:

- New scientific domains  
- Modern AI/ML computational tools  
- Expanded geoscience and engineering sections  
- Community-driven content contributions  

You are invited to be part of this ongoing evolution.
