# Finite Difference Method (FDM)

The Finite Difference Method approximates derivatives by discretizing the domain into grids and replacing differential operators with algebraic differences.

## 📐 Key Concepts
- Forward, backward, central differences  
- Explicit vs implicit schemes  
- Stability (CFL condition)  
- Time-marching methods  
- Grid discretization (uniform & non-uniform)  
- Error analysis & truncation error
